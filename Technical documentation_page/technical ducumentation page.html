            <p>Renowned as one of the most beautiful buildings in the world, the spellbinding Byzantine glory of the Aya
                Sofya Museum (Hagia Sophia) is not only one of the top things to do in Istanbul, but also in Turkey.</p>
            <p>The staggering bulk of its exterior is rimmed by the delicate minarets added after the Ottoman conquest, while
                the sumptuous and cavernous frescoed interior is a grand reminder of old Constantinople's might and power.
                This famed monument is a must-do for every tourist visiting the country.</p>

            <p>Not to be missed, the mighty ruin of Ephesus is a city of colossal monuments and marble-columned roads. One
                of the most complete, still-standing Roman cities in the Mediterranean region, this is the place to experience
                what life must have been like during the golden age of the Roman Empire.</p>
            <p>A sightseeing trip here will take at least half a day to cover the major highlights and longer, if you really
                want to explore, so make sure you plan your visit so you don't feel rushed.</p>

            <p>The surreal, swooping rock valleys of Cappadocia are every photographer's dream. Cliff ridges and hill crests
                are home to rippling panoramas of wave-like rock or wacky-shaped pinnacles that have been formed by millennia
                of wind and water action.</p>
            <p>And if you don't feel like hiking for the views, this is one of the world's top destinations to take a hot
                air balloon ride. If the lunar-scape isn't enough to tempt you, nestled in these valleys are the frescoed
                rock-cut churches of the Byzantine Era, when this area was an important early Christian site.</p>

            <p>Sumptuous beyond belief, the Topkapi Palace takes you into the fantastical, opulent world of the sultans.
                It was from here that the sultans of the Ottoman Era carved out an empire that would extend up into Europe
                and down through the Middle East and into Africa.</p>
            <p>The interiors, with their decadently exuberant tiling and lavish jeweled decor, are an unforgettable peek
                into the Ottoman's power base. The surrounding public gardens were once the sole domain of the Royal Court
                but are now open to the public and provide a tranquil, green respite from the city streets.</p>

            <header>Pamukkale</header>

            <p>One of Turkey's most famous natural wonders, the pure white travertine terraces of Pamukkale ("Cotton Castle"
                in English) cascade down the slope looking like an out-of-place snowfield amid the green landscape. Although
                the travertines are themselves a highlight of a Turkey trip, the vast and rambling ruins of Roman Hierapolis,
                an ancient spa town, lie on the top of this calcite hill, providing another reason to visit.</p>
            <p>For the best photographs, come at dusk when the travertines glow as the sun sinks below the horizon.</p>

            <header>Sumela Monastery</header>

            <p>With its stunning, lonely setting, built into a cliff face, Sumela Monastery (Monastery of the Virgin Mary)
                is the star attraction for visitors along the Black Sea Coast. Wandering around this abandoned religious
                complex, with its church interiors crammed with dazzling and vibrant frescoes, is a must for anyone who makes
                the long journey to Turkey's northeast region.</p>
            <p>The monastery first opened during the Byzantine era and was only closed in 1923. Today, wandering its empty
                cells, it's easy to imagine the isolated lives of the monks who once lived here.</p>

            <header>Mount Nemrut</header>

            <p>The top sightseeing drawcard for Eastern Turkey, Mount Nemrut's summit funerary mound is scattered with the
                broken remnants of once mammoth statues, which guarded it. This weird and lonely place has to be one of Turkey's
                most peculiar archaeological sites. The giant stone heads of long-forgotten gods stare out from the summit,
                casting an eerie atmosphere over the barren mountaintop. The time to come is at sunrise, so you can watch
                the statues as they loom out of the dark.</p>
